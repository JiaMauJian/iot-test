 * 下拉電阻要接多少會影響什麼? (原文:If you're planning to have the sensor in a bright area and use a 10KΩ pulldown, it will quickly saturate. That means that it will hit the 'ceiling' of 5V and not be able to differentiate between kinda bright and really bright. In that case, you should replace the 10KΩ pulldown with a 1KΩ pulldown. In that case, it will not be able to detect dark level differences as well but it will be able to detect bright light differences better. This is a tradeoff that you will have to decide upon!)
 * 如果你接10KΩ它就很難區分"亮"和"超亮"，可以改用1KΩ，但反之1KΩ它就很難區分"暗"和"超暗"
